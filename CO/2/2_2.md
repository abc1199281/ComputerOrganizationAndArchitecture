# Operations of the Computer Hardware

1. $add a,b,c$:
    - instructs a computer to add the two variables $b$ and $c$ and to put their sum in $a$.
2. This notation is rigid in that each RISC-V arithmetic instruction performs only one operation and must always have **exactly three variables**.
3. Comments: double slashes
4. **Design Principle 1: Simplicity favors regularity.**
