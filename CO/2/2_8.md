# Supporting Procedures in Computer Hardware

## Introduction
1. Six step
    1. Put parameters in a place where the procedure can access them
    2. Transfer control to the procedure.
    3. Acquire the storage resources needed for the procedure.
    4. Perform the desired task.
    5. Put the result value in a place where the calling program can access it.
    6. Return control to the point of origin, since a procedure can be called from several points in a program.

2. The registers convention
    1. x10-x17: eight parameter registers in which to pass parameters or return values.
    2. x1: one return address register to return to the point of origin. these registers, RISC-V assembly.

3. Jump-and-link Instruction:
    - ```jal x1, ProcedureAddress```
    - An instruction that branches to an address and simultaneously save the address of the following instruction in a register (usually x1 in RISC-V).
    - Link = return address

4. Indirect jump
    - ```jal x1, x```
        - branch to procedure x (**callee**)
    - ```jalr x0, 0(x1)```
        - returns control to the caler

    - Void runction
        - ```jal x0, Label // unconditionally branch to Label```

5. program counter
    - instruction address register

## Using More Registers
1. Motive:
    - What if we return and pass more parameters?
    - Answer: Stack pointers
        - We need to **spill** registers to memory.
2. Stack pointers
    - By historical precedent, stacks “grow” from higher addresses to lower addresses.
    - This convention means that you push values onto
the stack by subtracting from the stack pointer.
    

3. Example: Compiling a C Procedure That Doesn’t Call
Another Procedure
    - C Procedure
    ~~~c++
    int64_t leaf_example(int64_t g, int64_t h, int64_t i, int64_t j){
        int64_t f;
        f = (g+h)-(i+j);
        return f;
    }
    ~~~
    - Assembly
```
leaf_example:
    addi sp, sp, -24 // adjust stack to make room for 3 items
    sd x5, 16(sp) // save register x5 for use afterwards
    sd x6, 8(sp) // save register x6 for use afterwards
    sd x20, 0(sp) // save register x20 for use afterwards

    add x5, x10, x11// register x5 contains g + h
    add x6, x12, x13// register x6 contains i + j
    sub x20, x5, x6// f = x5 − x6, which is (g + h)−(i + j) 

    addi x10, x20, 0 // returns f (x10 = x20 + 0)

    ld x20, 0(sp) // restore register x20 for caller
    ld x6, 8(sp) // restore register x6 for caller
    ld x5, 16(sp) // restore register x5 for caller
    addi sp, sp, 24 // adjust stack to delete 3 items

    jalr x0, 0(x1) // branch back to calling routine
```
4. Types of registers
    - x5-x7 & x28-x31
        - Not preserved by the callee.
    - x8-x9 & x18-x27: saved registers that must be preserved on a procedure call.
